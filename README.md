# Bowling Calculator
A calculator to calculate the score for a game of bowling. The scores for individual frames are shown, rather than the running total. Strike and spare frames are highlighted. 


## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/rose-mead/bowling-calculator.git 
cd bowling-calculator
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


## Areas for improvement
- Handle the focus when clicking on the inputs, so the 0 is overwritten.
- Add functionality to click on a frame total and see the balls that are being used to calculate that total highlighted.
